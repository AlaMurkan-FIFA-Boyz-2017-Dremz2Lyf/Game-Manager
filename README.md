# Game-Manager

Game Manager is an app for managing a local (offline) competition. Currently designed around FIFA (the video game, not the corrupt worldwide body responsible for managing the beautiful game known as, and rightfully called, football) with the intent of keeping records of players and handling the planning and organizing of round robin style tournaments between friends.
